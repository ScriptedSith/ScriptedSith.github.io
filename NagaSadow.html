        Darth Naga Sadow was a master Sith alchemist and Dark Lord of the Sith who, in 5000 BBY, took the Sith Empire to the brink of galactic domination in the Great Hyperspace War. A half-breed Sith from Ziost, Sadow ruled over a secret citadel on the moon Khar Shian, where he became one of the most powerful Sith magicians of his time.<br><br>A member of the ten-member Sith Council under Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos' reign, Sadow's preached an expansionist philosophy put him at odds with much of the isolated Empire's establishment. Sadow was considered a major candidate for Dark Lord after Ragnos' death, leading him into a power struggle with conservative rival Ludo Kressh that only ended with the surprise arrival of two explorers from the far-off Republic.<br><br>Sadow saw an opportunity in the two explorers—siblings Gav and Jori Daragon—and used the suspicion and fear raised by their arrival to foment war with the Republic. Along the way, Sadow shattered Kressh's forces at Khar Delba, leaving no challengers to his authority. With Kressh seemingly out of the picture, Sadow gathered together all the Sith Lords and built a formidable military force to conquer the Republic, while also taking Gav Daragon as his Sith apprentice.<br><br>When the time was right, Sadow and his forces launched a massive surprise attack on the Republic, a many-pronged strike aimed at conquering the important Koros system while seizing the Republic capital of Coruscant. For his part, Sadow stayed isolated in his Sith meditation sphere, augmenting his forces with illusory beasts and ships.<br><br>Sadow's efforts initially met with great success, and he was on the cusp of victory when events turned against him. Gav Daragon turned coat once back home and attacked Sadow in his meditation sphere, breaking his concentration and dissipating his illusions. His momentum halted, Sadow killed Daragon and fled home, only to find a still-alive Ludo Kressh waiting for him with his own army. Sadow managed to deal his rival a final defeat before immediately being forced into battle again with a pursuing Republic force.<br><br>Seeing he could not win, Sadow escaped with a daring run through the twin stars of the Denarii Nova and made his way to the uninhabited moon of Yavin 4. Sadow practiced his alchemy alone there for decades, building massive temple complexes, before voluntarily placing himself in suspended animation. He was awoken some 600 years later by a fallen Jedi named Freedon Nadd, who learned the former Dark Lord of the Sith's secrets before killing him.
