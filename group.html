      <h2>Origins on Korriban</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The tale of the Sith Brotherhood starts on the desolate and
        awe-inspiring world of Korriban, with crimson dunes and looming tombs
        of ancient Sith Lords whispering secrets of unbridled power. It was on
        this forsaken planet that had once been the cradle of the Sith species
        that the foundation for the Brotherhood was laid. United by the vision
        of the Emperor himself-a Sith Lord of incomparable charisma and
        power-the Brotherhood attracted acolytes, warriors, and scholars from
        across the galaxy.<br /><br />Then, of course, there was the enigmatic
        figure of the Emperor himself, who boasted of having found the
        long-lost holocrons of Ajunta Pall and Tulak Hord. These relics
        contained fragments of ancient Sith alchemy and forbidden knowledge of
        the Force. With it, the Emperor began rebuilding the Sith Order,
        bringing together fragmented factions of Force-wielders and rogue Sith
        under one banner. Unlike other Sith Lords-ambition often had them
        attacking each other-the Emperor preached unity, not out of altruism,
        but for domination.<br /><br />Korriban had become a proving ground for the
        Brotherhood. They take the recruits to the Valley of the Dark Lords
        and just pushed them ruthlessly. The ones that couldn't make it became
        either sand or execution-sacrifice to the dark side. Only the
        strongest survive, emerge as Sith Knights and Lords, loyal only to the
        Emperor's dream of galactic conquest.<br /><br />The first months were marked by
        blood and revelation on Korriban: digs that disclosed long-buried
        tombs, decoding of ancient Sith texts by the Brotherhood's scholars.
        With every find, the Emperor became stronger, asserting that the dark
        side guided his steps. Closer he bound himself to the Force; more
        spread out the rumors among all of his followers: their Emperor was no
        ordinary Sith.
      </p>

      <h2>The Emperor’s Ascension</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Two months into the life of the Brotherhood, an event took place in the history of the Sith that reordered its
        fate: the Emperor, deep in meditation in the Tomb of Marka Ragnos, had undergone a transformation unique in the
        history of the Sith. Pulsating with power to a degree whereby even his most stalwart followers dared not
        approach him, he exited the tomb. His voice, once a command of authority, now carried an unnatural cadence, the
        echoes of many souls speaking through one mouth.<br /><br />He had ascended into a Dark Side Entity-a being
        beyond mortality, drawing directly from the infinite well of dark side energy. He had spoken to an ancient
        force, a primordial consciousness older than the Sith Order itself. The dark side entity granted him knowledge
        and power beyond comprehension in return for him serving as its vessel and enforcer.<br /><br />This revelation
        shook the very foundation of the Brotherhood. Although some questioned the Emperor's claims, most had
        embracingly adopted his transformation as an act of will of the dark side. The ascension marked a turning point
        in the Brotherhood's philosophy: no longer was it just a Sith Order that strove for galactic domination but an
        instrument of a greater cosmic force. Their loyalty was now to be transferred from the mundane ambitions of the
        Emperor into the whim of the dark side creature itself.<br /><br />In order to consecrate this new order, the
        Emperor ordered the construction of a great temple on Korriban-to commemorate his rise and the Brotherhood's
        holy purpose. Soon enough, however, the will of the being shifted the sights of the Emperor elsewhere.
      </p>

      <h2>The Move to Yavin IV</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Months into his rise, the Emperor called the council of the Brotherhood. The dark side entity had bestowed on
        him visions: Yavin IV, a jungle moon bathed in dark side energy, was to be their new home. The ancient Massassi
        temples-strongholds of Naga Sadow-pulsed with latent power, waiting for the Brotherhood to tap into
        it.<br /><br />There, they fell into a mix of feelings. Many members questioned such a move, especially those
        too used to the harsh and familiar sands of Korriban. But the Emperor's word was law, and so the Brotherhood
        commenced, evacuating its holocrons and artifacts and war machines en-mass across the galaxy to Yavin IV's
        verdant jungles.<br /><br />When they arrived, the Brotherhood found the moon to be as deadly as it was
        resplendent: thick overgrowth and hidden predators beset them on every side, and ancient Massassi temples were
        haven and labyrinth both. Yet undeniably present was a dark side presence. Atop the Great Temple, meditation led
        the Emperor to proclaim this to be their nexus of destiny.<br /><br />Soon, the Brotherhood set to work,
        adapting the Massassi ruins into fortress, academies, and sanctuaries. It was in the temples, now converted into
        great ritual and experimental sites, that the Sith alchemists and sorcerers dug deep into the secrets of life
        and death. The jungle itself seemed to start responding to their presence-the once chaotic energy bent now to
        the Emperor's will.
      </p>

      <h2>The Entity’s Influence</h2>
      <p class="description">
        As the Brotherhood settled in on Yavin IV, the Emperor grew closer to the dark side entity. The Emperor would
        often go off into solitude, sometimes for days, and commune with the entity. Returning after such sessions, he
        passed decrees and strategies that proved almost prophetic, as if to say he was able to see the development of
        events unfolding in the galaxy.<br /><br />Elaborate rituals to this being now started getting adopted by the
        Brotherhood. The life forces, in great ceremonies, were offered to this being with sacrifices of Jedi captives
        and disloyal Sith starting to occur frequently. He introduced a new philosophy mixing the ideology of the Sith
        with teachings from the entity: whereas ambition and strength were still core tenets, now these were means to
        serve the entity's purpose - whatever that might be.<br /><br />The Emperor spread the Brotherhood throughout
        the galaxy. Fleets launched from secret shipyards on Yavin IV struck in crushing attacks against Republic
        outposts and Jedi enclaves, and with each victory came the construction of dark side nexuses, amplifying the
        entity's presence within the galaxy.
      </p>

      <h2>The Emperor and the Dark Side Entity</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Only the Emperor and the Emperor alone can access the mysterious Dark Side Entity, the ancient force that has
        steered them since the time of the Emperor’s ascension. This relationship is not a matter of Force mastery, but
        destiny; the Entity has chosen the Emperor as its only access to the material world.<br /><br />It is this
        religious attachment that forms a fundamental part of the Brotherhood’s ethos. The Emperor’s utterances are
        viewed as the commandments of the Lord, since they are not his own, but the will of the Entity itself. Jedi
        Lords and followers alike view him with a combination of awe and dread, knowing that to challenge the Emperor is
        to challenge the Dark Side Entity.<br /><br />To bolster this connection, rituals are held frequently in the
        Great Temple on Yavin IV. These rituals involve sacrifices of blood, relics and vital energy, all directed by
        the Emperor towards the Entity. In these ceremonies, the Emperor is often teleported into a state of trance, his
        voice filled with supernatural tone as he utters the Entity’s will.<br /><br />The Emperor’s communion with the
        Entity, too, is a mystery. He’s teased us with future galactic events, a plan to control the Force itself, and
        the Sith’s eventual rise to power over the galaxy. But he has also warned of the Entity’s incomprehensible
        desires, cautioning his subjects that their ultimate goal might be beyond mortal reach.
      </p>

      <h2>The Era of Yavin IV</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Relocation to Yavin IV marked a whole new era of power and ambition for the Brotherhood. The ancient Massassi
        temples on this jungle moon served as more than just shelters; they were repositories of dark side energy,
        leftovers from the experiments of Naga Sadow. These temples became cornerstones for the new society of the
        Brotherhood.<br /><br /><br /><b>Life Within the Brotherhood</b><br /><br />Life on Yavin IV is a daily struggle
        of seeking power and strengthening the Brotherhood. Sith Lords oversee training sessions with acolytes pushed to
        the limits in combat, strategy, and mastery of the Force. The alchemists and sorcerers of the Brotherhood
        experiment with Sithspawn, creating monstrous beings for guardianship and weapons.<br /><br />The temples
        themselves are alive with activity: the Great Temple is the seat of the Emperor's power, a focal point for the
        rituals and decrees; the Temple of Exar Kun is a domain of forbidden experiments, testing the boundaries of life
        and death. Other temples serve as academies, armories, and quarters for the Sith's ever-growing
        ranks.<br /><br /><br /><b>Raids and Expansion</b><br /><br />Under the leadership of Darth Malgus, Yavin IV
        becomes a staging ground for Brotherhood raids against the Jedi and the Republic. Assaults are not simple acts
        of aggression but rather strategic efforts to weaken their enemies and sow terror across the galaxy. Each raid
        yields new resources, prisoners of war, and even some Force-sensitives to swell the
        ranks.<br /><br /><br /><b>Morale and Unity</b><br /><br />Darth Acina herself oversees morale to keep the
        Brotherhood together. Her work varies from the organization of great ceremonies and tournaments of combat to
        events that celebrate the triumphs of the Brotherhood. She also initiates new programs and policies to keep the
        lower ranks busy, such as rewarding systems for good performance and promotions.
      </p>

      <h2>Late Days On Yavin IV</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The Sith Brotherhood is today a monolith of terror and respect. The Emperor himself, little more than a vessel
        these days, is steadfastly determined to channel his followers, who are first and foremost loyal to him, and
        second to the dark side entity itself, into a campaign of carrying out his will with unholy
        fervor.<br /><br />Yavin IV has become a beacon of darkness, its temples radiating oppressive energy throughout
        the system. The Brotherhood continues to grow with new recruits, drawn in by the promise of power and the allure
        of the dark side. Yet, whispers of dissent still linger. Some question the true intentions of the entity,
        fearing they may only be pawns in a game far larger than they can comprehend.<br /><br />But the final goal of
        the Emperor is still vague. The purpose might be either galactic dominance or absolute loyalty to the entity per
        se. What does he, the very entity want? All these questions soar in the air among members of the Brotherhood,
        pushing them deeper into the shadows for explanations.<br /><br />For the time being, the Sith Brotherhood
        thrives, its fate to be left at the mercy of the dark side entity. The galaxy is vast, however, and the forces
        of light are not to remain in one place. A storm brews, and the Brotherhood readies to embrace it, convinced
        that darkness shall prevail.
      </p>

      <h2>The Brotherhood’s Future: Destiny in Shadows</h2>
      <p class="description">
        As the Sith Brotherhood thrives on Yavin IV, their plans for the galaxy remain shrouded in mystery. The Emperor,
        guided by the Dark Side Entity, speaks of a coming era where the Sith will reign supreme, their enemies crushed
        beneath their heel. Yet, the Entity’s true desires remain a source of unease.<br /><br />Whispers among the
        lower ranks speak of visions of destruction and chaos, of a galaxy consumed by darkness. Some question whether
        the Entity’s will aligns with the Brotherhood’s goals, while others see no distinction between their ambitions
        and the Entity’s purpose.<br /><br />For now, the Brotherhood marches forward, their faith in the Emperor and
        the Entity unshaken. Their home on Yavin IV stands as a beacon of their power, a fortress from which they will
        reshape the galaxy. The Sith Code echoes through the jungle moon, a testament to their unyielding
        resolve:<br /><br />Peace is a lie, there is only passion.<br />Through passion, I gain strength.<br />Through
        strength, I gain power.<br />Through power, I gain victory.<br />Through victory, my chains are broken.<br />The
        Force shall free me.<br /><br />And so, the Sith Brotherhood continues its ascent, bound to the dark side and to
        the Emperor who speaks for it, their eyes fixed on a galaxy waiting to be conquered.
