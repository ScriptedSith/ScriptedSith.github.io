        Sith-Human hybrid, Marka Ragnos was a direct descendant from a Dark Jedi who had fled the Republic after the Hundred-Year Darkness, who lived 20,000 years after the formation of the Old Republic. Feared, obeyed, and admired among the Sith, Ragnos was considered to have been the greatest Dark Lord of the Sith of his age and was born a long time before 5100 BBY.<br><br>When the Dark Lord of the Sith died, Ragnos and another powerful Sith, Simus, rose up to take the mantle. A formidable warrior, Ragnos dueled and defeated Simus in combat circa 5100 BBY, proving himself worthy of the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith.<br><br>After gaining the mantle of a Dark Lord, he led ruthless campaigns against his Sith enemies, pitting his adversaries against each other and ensuring that there were no threats to his throne. His iron-fisted rule would last over a century.<br><br>During those times Ragnos likely composed his own epistle, created a Scepter capable of siphoning the Force from many different places, which could be used to empower non-Force users, and designed a pair of gauntlets capable of augmenting the strength of the Force in its user.<br><br>Years later, Ragnos, as Dark Lord of the Sith and the ruler of the Sith Council and Sith Empire, was petitioned by a thirteen-year-old boy named Tenebrae. The youth had come before Marka Ragnos to ask for training in the Sith arts and for recognition as the ruler of his father's domain, the planet Medriaas.<br><br>Although he declined to take him as an apprentice, Lord Ragnos was impressed by Tenebrae's power and ambition, and named him the ruler of Medriaas, bestowing on him the rank of Sith Lord and the name Vitiate.<br><br>After years of his rule, Marka Ragnos passed away in 5000 BBY. His death was marked as the end of a golden age of the Sith Empire, despite its reluctance to continue expansion.
