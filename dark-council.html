    <section>
      <h2>The Supreme Authority</h2>
      <p class="description">
        At the apex of the Sith Brotherhood's hierarchy stands the Dark Council, a body of the most powerful and cunning
        Sith Lords in the galaxy. These twelve masters of the dark side serve as the Emperor's advisors, commanders, and
        executors of his will. Each member has earned their position through displays of overwhelming power, strategic
        brilliance, and unwavering loyalty to the Brotherhood's cause.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure and Hierarchy</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The Dark Council operates under a strict hierarchy, with each member overseeing specific spheres of influence
        within the Brotherhood. At the head sits the Emperor himself, whose word is absolute law. Below him, the twelve
        Dark Lords each command their own domains, from military operations to ancient knowledge, from technological
        advancement to diplomatic relations.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Dark Council Members:</h2>
      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Mortis - Dark Lord of Law and Doctrine</strong><br />
        Darth Mortis serves as the arbiter of the Sith Brotherhood’s legal and doctrinal framework. He is tasked with
        upholding the Emperor’s decrees, enforcing the Sith Code, and ensuring that the Brotherhood’s structure remains
        disciplined and functional. Mortis views law not as a constraint but as a weapon—a tool to maintain order and
        crush dissent.<br /><br />Mortis’s office is a solemn chamber within the Great Temple on Yavin IV, where
        disputes among Sith Lords, accusations of treachery, and challenges to authority are brought before him. Those
        who stand before Darth Mortis seeking judgment find no mercy; he embodies the ruthlessness of the Sith ideal.
        Punishments for breaking the Brotherhood’s laws range from public executions to exile, and Mortis often delivers
        these sentences personally, using them as opportunities to demonstrate the consequences of
        defiance.<br /><br />Mortis also oversees the propagation of the Sith Code. He ensures that all members, from
        acolytes to Dark Councilors, live by its tenets. To Mortis, the Code is not just a philosophy but a binding
        contract with the dark side itself, and any deviation is seen as both heresy and weakness.<br /><br />Mortis’s
        demeanor is cold and methodical. He believes that chaos within the Brotherhood is the greatest threat to its
        survival, and his efforts to preserve order are relentless. Though some see his adherence to law as overly
        rigid, none can deny the strength of the Brotherhood under his watch.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Ravage - Dark Lord of Human Resources and Trials</strong><br />
        Darth Ravage holds the critical role of managing the Brotherhood’s hierarchy, focusing on the efficient
        operation of its High and Mid-Rank members. Ravage is not just an administrator; he is a master tactician,
        leveraging his position to maximize the effectiveness of the Brotherhood’s leadership.<br /><br />Ravage ensures
        that high-ranking Sith maintain their quotas of training, recruitment, and overall leadership duties. He also
        works closely with mid-rank members, facilitating trials and overseeing their progression to higher ranks. His
        attention to detail ensures that the Sith leadership remains strong, disciplined, and devoid of
        incompetence.<br /><br />Ravage operates with a brutal sense of efficiency. He does not tolerate laziness or
        failure, and those who fall short of his expectations often face public humiliation or demotion. However, for
        those who meet or exceed his standards, Ravage is a staunch advocate, providing resources and opportunities to
        help them ascend further within the Brotherhood.<br /><br />Ravage views his role as integral to the
        Brotherhood’s success. By fostering competition and ensuring only the most capable rise to positions of power,
        he strengthens the entire organization. Though his methods are harsh, they have earned him a reputation as one
        of the most effective leaders in the Sith Brotherhood.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Vowrawn - Dark Lord of Diplomacy and Alliances</strong><br />
        Darth Vowrawn is the head of the Division of Diplomacy (DD), the Sith Brotherhood’s arm for managing alliances,
        negotiations, and political strategy. A master manipulator and silver-tongued orator, Vowrawn thrives in the
        complex web of galactic politics, turning enemies into allies and allies into unwitting pawns.<br /><br />Under
        Vowrawn’s leadership, the Division of Diplomacy forges critical alliances with other factions, both Sith-aligned
        and otherwise. His agents infiltrate rival organizations, subtly steering their policies to align with the
        Brotherhood’s goals. Vowrawn also oversees propaganda campaigns designed to sow dissent among the Republic and
        Jedi Order, weakening their resolve and unity.<br /><br />Unlike many Sith, Vowrawn prefers to wield his
        influence through persuasion rather than brute force. His charisma and strategic mind make him a formidable
        presence in both the council chambers and the battlefield of diplomacy. Despite his outward charm, Vowrawn is as
        ruthless as any Sith Lord, willing to betray or destroy even his closest allies if it serves the Brotherhood’s
        objectives.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Acina - Dark Lord of Morale and Innovation</strong><br />
        Darth Acina is the overseer of Morale and Innovation, a position that requires creativity, adaptability, and an
        understanding of the Brotherhood’s needs. Acina’s primary goal is to maintain the Brotherhood’s cohesion,
        ensuring that its members remain loyal, motivated, and focused on their collective purpose.<br /><br />Acina
        organizes grand events, ranging from combat tournaments to ceremonial celebrations of the Brotherhood’s
        victories. These events not only inspire loyalty but also foster competition among the ranks, pushing members to
        constantly improve themselves. She also introduces initiatives designed to enhance activity and engagement, such
        as reward systems for exceptional performance and opportunities for acolytes to interact with high-ranking Sith
        Lords.<br /><br />Acina’s role is not without its challenges. The Brotherhood is an organization built on
        ambition and rivalry, and maintaining unity among its members often feels like balancing on the edge of a blade.
        However, Acina’s innovative approach and deep understanding of Sith psychology make her uniquely suited to this
        role.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Malgus - Dark Lord of Raids and Warfare</strong><br />
        Darth Malgus is the supreme commander of the Brotherhood’s military campaigns, specializing in raids and
        large-scale warfare. His genius lies in his ability to coordinate devastating assaults that leave the
        Brotherhood’s enemies crippled and demoralized.<br /><br />Malgus oversees the planning and execution of raids
        on Jedi temples, Republic outposts, and rival factions. These missions are not only acts of aggression but also
        opportunities to gather resources, captives, and intelligence. Malgus’s forces are known for their precision and
        brutality, striking with overwhelming force and retreating before the enemy can mount a
        counterattack.<br /><br />Malgus is a warrior to his core, often leading raids personally to inspire his troops
        and strike fear into the hearts of his enemies. His reputation as an unstoppable force on the battlefield has
        made him a legend within the Brotherhood, and his leadership has been instrumental in their rise to power.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Nox (Inquisitorius</strong><br />
        Darth Nox commands the Inquisitorius (IQ), the Brotherhood’s division dedicated to hunting Jedi, rooting out
        heresies, and preserving the dark side’s purity. Nox is a master of Sith sorcery and alchemy, wielding powers
        that inspire awe and terror in equal measure.<br /><br />Under Nox’s leadership, the Inquisitorius has become
        one of the most feared arms of the Brotherhood. Her agents scour the galaxy for Jedi fugitives, rogue Sith, and
        artifacts of the Force. They operate with unmatched efficiency, using a combination of intelligence, sorcery,
        and combat prowess to eliminate threats to the Brotherhood’s supremacy.<br /><br />Nox herself is a figure of
        mystery, rarely seen outside of her private sanctum. Her experiments in Sith alchemy have produced horrifying
        creations, from Sithspawn beasts to cursed weapons. She views the Inquisitorius as an extension of her own will,
        a tool to shape the galaxy according to the dark side’s design.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Jadus (Intelligence and Espionage</strong><br />
        Darth Jadus leads the Imperial Intelligence (II), a shadowy division that gathers information and eliminates
        threats before they arise. Jadus’s agents are masters of stealth and subterfuge, operating in the shadows to
        ensure the Brotherhood remains one step ahead of its enemies.<br /><br />Jadus’s methods are as enigmatic as
        they are effective. He relies on a vast network of informants, spies, and assassins, all of whom operate under
        layers of secrecy. His ability to anticipate and counter his enemies’ moves has earned him the Emperor’s trust,
        as well as the fear of his rivals.<br /><br />Jadus is known for his cold and calculating demeanor. He believes
        that information is the ultimate weapon and wields it with surgical precision. Whether infiltrating Jedi
        enclaves or destabilizing Republic governments, the Intelligence Initiative operates with ruthless efficiency
        under his watch.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Marr (Head of the Dark Honor Guard</strong><br />
        Darth Marr oversees the Dark Honor Guard (DHG), an elite cadre of warriors and Force-wielders sworn to defend
        the Emperor and the leadership of the Sith Brotherhood. The DHG is more than just bodyguards; they are the
        embodiment of Sith discipline, loyalty, and combat mastery. Marr himself is a paragon of these
        qualities—unwavering in his dedication to the Emperor and the will of the Dark Side Entity.<br /><br />Under
        Marr’s leadership, the DHG operates with unparalleled efficiency, protecting critical assets, fortifying Sith
        strongholds, and maintaining order within the Brotherhood. They are called upon to safeguard the Emperor during
        ceremonies and battles, ensuring that no harm comes to the conduit of the Dark Side Entity. Members of the DHG
        are selected through grueling trials, where only the strongest and most loyal survive.<br /><br />Marr views the
        DHG not just as protectors but as symbols of the Brotherhood’s power and unity. He trains them personally,
        instilling in them a sense of purpose beyond individual ambition: to uphold the Emperor’s vision at any
        cost.<br /><br />In combat, Marr is a towering force, clad in heavy armor and wielding a crimson blade that
        burns with the fury of the dark side. His presence inspires fear in enemies and unwavering loyalty in allies. To
        stand against Marr is to face the full wrath of the Sith Brotherhood’s discipline and strength.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Baras (Head of the Reavers</strong><br />
        Darth Baras leads the Reavers (REV), the Brotherhood’s elite assassins, whose purpose is to eliminate high-value
        targets and sow chaos among the Brotherhood’s enemies. The Reavers are shadows in the night, masters of stealth,
        subterfuge, and lethal precision. Baras, a cunning strategist and manipulator, has elevated the Reavers into one
        of the most feared divisions in the galaxy.<br /><br />Baras is known for his ability to identify and exploit
        weaknesses, both in individuals and in entire organizations. He uses the Reavers not only to assassinate but
        also to destabilize governments, dismantle rival factions, and strike fear into the hearts of the Jedi and
        Republic leadership. Every mission is meticulously planned, with contingencies for every possible
        scenario.<br /><br />Baras’s leadership style is marked by secrecy and psychological manipulation. He rarely
        appears in person, preferring to communicate through intermediaries and cryptic messages. This enigmatic
        presence enhances his mystique, making him both respected and feared among the Brotherhood.<br /><br />Reavers
        are trained in a variety of disciplines, including espionage, advanced lightsaber combat, and Sith alchemy.
        Their methods are as diverse as they are deadly, ranging from direct assassination to elaborate schemes that
        destroy their targets from within. Baras personally oversees the training of promising recruits, ensuring they
        meet his exacting standards.<br /><br />In addition to his role as the head of the Reavers, Baras serves as a
        vital intelligence asset, often working closely with Darth Jadus to share insights and strategies. Together,
        they ensure the Sith Brotherhood remains one step ahead of its enemies.

      <h2>The Council Chamber</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Deep within the Great Temple on Yavin IV lies the Council Chamber, a massive circular room carved from ancient
        stone and infused with dark side energy. Twelve ornate thrones surround the Emperor's seat, each representing
        one of the Dark Lords. The chamber itself pulses with malevolent power, amplifying the connection between the
        Council members and the dark side entity that guides them.
      </p>

      <h2>Rituals and Ceremonies</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The Dark Council convenes monthly during the new moon, when the dark side energy on Yavin IV reaches its peak.
        These gatherings involve not only strategic planning and policy decisions but also dark rituals that strengthen
        their connection to the entity. Blood offerings, ancient incantations, and displays of power mark these solemn
        occasions.
      </p>

      <h2>The Council's Will</h2>
      <p class="description">
        When the Dark Council speaks, the entire Brotherhood listens. Their decrees shape the destiny of thousands of
        Sith Lords, Knights, and acolytes across the galaxy. Each decision is made with the ultimate goal of furthering
        the entity's mysterious purpose and expanding the Brotherhood's dominion over the Force itself.
      </p>

      <p class="description">

        knowledge, the arbiters of internal disputes, and the architects of the Brotherhood's future. Their combined
        wisdom and power ensure that the Sith Brotherhood remains united in purpose and unstoppable in its advance
        toward galactic supremacy.
