      <p class="description">
        The Emperor is the supreme leader, but the Dark Council is what keeps the Brotherhood running smoothly. Each of
        its members has a specialized role to play in the governing of a critical aspect of the Brotherhood's affairs.

      <h2>The Emperor’s Powerbase: A Manifestation of Absolute Authority</h2>
      <p class="description">
        In the Sith Brotherhood, the Emperor’s powerbase is the core structure that sustains his rule and projects his
        will throughout the organization. A powerbase in Sith culture refers to a collective of resources, individuals,
        and networks loyal to a single leader, used to consolidate authority and execute their plans. The Emperor’s
        powerbase is unparalleled in the Brotherhood, consisting of his most trusted and capable lieutenants who serve
        as extensions of his influence. Each member of the powerbase fulfills a critical role, ensuring the Emperor’s
        absolute dominion over the Sith and its operations.<br /><br />While the Dark Council governs broader aspects of
        the Brotherhood, the powerbase ensures its internal efficiency and alignment with the Emperor’s will. These
        individuals are handpicked by the Emperor himself, embodying the pinnacle of Sith ideology: loyalty tempered by
        ambition, strength guided by intellect, and purpose driven by the dark side’s calling. Together, they form a
        tightly knit hierarchy of authority that keeps the Brotherhood in perfect order.
