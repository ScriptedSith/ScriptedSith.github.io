        The Sith Brotherhood was a sect of Force-sensitives who utilized the
        dark side of the Force. The Sith were the most infamous of all dark side
        practices, and the members of the order were often seen as the pinnacle
        of power within the dark side. A force not to challenge, forged from
        militarism and fueled by the almighty power of the dark side of the
        Force. United by the supreme master, the Emperor and the Dark Council.

        Peace is a lie, there is only passion.<br />
        Through passion, I gain strength.<br />
        Through strength, I gain power.<br />
        Through power, I gain victory.<br />
        Through victory, my chains are broken.<br />
        The Force shall free me.
