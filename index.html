        The Sith Brotherhood stands as a unified order of dark side warriors who follow the ancient Sith path through strength, discipline, and loyalty. Unlike the fractured orders of the past, our Brotherhood endures through unity rather than division. Bound by the dark side and the will of our leaders, we serve the Empire not as individuals vying for power, but as one force devoted to dominance and legacy. Under the rule of the Emperor and guidance of the Dark Council, the Brotherhood thrives in structure, honor, and fearlessness.<br />
        To walk among us is to abandon isolation.<br />
        To stand with us is to embrace power through unity.
      </p>

      <p class="sithcode">
        Peace is a lie, there is only passion.<br />
        Through passion, I gain strength.<br />
        Through strength, I gain power.<br />
        Through power, I gain victory.<br />
        Through victory, my chains are broken.<br />
        The Force shall free me.
