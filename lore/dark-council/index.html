    <section>
      <h2>The Supreme Authority</h2>
      <p class="description">
        At the apex of the Sith Brotherhood's hierarchy stands the Dark Council, a body of the most powerful and cunning
        Sith Lords in the galaxy. These twelve masters of the dark side serve as the Emperor's advisors, commanders, and
        executors of his will. Each member has earned their position through displays of overwhelming power, strategic
        brilliance, and unwavering loyalty to the Brotherhood's cause.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure and Hierarchy</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The Dark Council operates under a strict hierarchy, with each member overseeing specific spheres of influence
        within the Brotherhood. At the head sits the Emperor himself, whose word is absolute law. Below him, the twelve
        Dark Lords each command their own domains, from military operations to ancient knowledge, from technological
        advancement to diplomatic relations.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Dark Council Members:</h2>
      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Aelthel - Dark Lord of Law and Doctrine</strong><br />
        Darth Aelthel serves as the arbiter of the Sith Brotherhood’s legal and doctrinal framework. He is tasked with
        upholding the Emperor’s decrees, enforcing the Sith Code, and ensuring that the Brotherhood’s structure remains
        disciplined and functional. Aelthel views law not as a constraint but as a weapon—a tool to maintain order and
        crush dissent.<br /><br />Aelthel’s office is a solemn chamber within the Great Temple on Yavin IV, where
        disputes among Sith Lords, accusations of treachery, and challenges to authority are brought before him. Those
        who stand before Darth Aelthel seeking judgment find no mercy; he embodies the ruthlessness of the Sith ideal.
        Punishments for breaking the Brotherhood’s laws range from public executions to exile, and Aelthel often delivers
        these sentences personally, using them as opportunities to demonstrate the consequences of
        defiance.<br /><br />Aelthel also oversees the propagation of the Sith Code. He ensures that all members, from
        acolytes to Dark Councilors, live by its tenets. To Aelthel, the Code is not just a philosophy but a binding
        contract with the dark side itself, and any deviation is seen as both heresy and weakness.<br /><br />Aelthel’s
        demeanor is cold and methodical. He believes that chaos within the Brotherhood is the greatest threat to its
        survival, and his efforts to preserve order are relentless. Though some see his adherence to law as overly
        rigid, none can deny the strength of the Brotherhood under his watch.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Cassian - Dark Lord of Human Resources and Trials</strong><br />
        Darth Cassian holds the critical role of managing the Brotherhood’s hierarchy, focusing on the efficient
        operation of its High and Mid-Rank members. Cassian is not just an administrator; he is a master tactician,
        leveraging his position to maximize the effectiveness of the Brotherhood’s leadership.<br /><br />Cassian ensures
        that high-ranking Sith maintain their quotas of training, recruitment, and overall leadership duties. He also
        works closely with mid-rank members, facilitating trials and overseeing their progression to higher ranks. His
        attention to detail ensures that the Sith leadership remains strong, disciplined, and devoid of
        incompetence.<br /><br />Cassian operates with a brutal sense of efficiency. He does not tolerate laziness or
        failure, and those who fall short of his expectations often face public humiliation or demotion. However, for
        those who meet or exceed his standards, Cassian is a staunch advocate, providing resources and opportunities to
        help them ascend further within the Brotherhood.<br /><br />Cassian views his role as integral to the
        Brotherhood’s success. By fostering competition and ensuring only the most capable rise to positions of power,
        he strengthens the entire organization. Though his methods are harsh, they have earned him a reputation as one
        of the most effective leaders in the Sith Brotherhood.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        <strong>Darth Magnus - Dark Lord of Diplomacy and Alliances</strong><br />
        Darth Magnus is the head of the Division of Recruitment and Rank Management (DRRM),
        the Sith Brotherhood’s arm for overseeing new initiates, training protocols, and the hierarchy of lower-ranked members.
        A meticulous organizer and strict disciplinarian, Magnus excels at identifying talent, enforcing loyalty,
        and ensuring the Brotherhood’s ranks remain both capable and obedient.<br /><br />Under Magnus’s leadership, the Division recruits promising Force-sensitive individuals
        and integrates them into the Brotherhood’s structure. He monitors the development of apprentices and acolytes, assigning mentors and missions designed to test their skills and
        loyalty. Magnus also enforces discipline among lower-ranked members, swiftly rooting out incompetence or dissent to maintain the strength and cohesion of the order.<br /><br />Unlike
        some Sith who rely solely on intimidation, Magnus balances rigor with strategic guidance. His deep understanding of potential and ambition allows him to mold raw recruits into loyal and
        efficient operatives. Beneath his calm and calculated demeanor, Magnus is as ruthless as any Sith Lord, ready to eliminate those who threaten the Brotherhood’s hierarchy or betray its principles.

        <strong>Darth Novius - Dark Lord of Morale and Innovation</strong><br />
        Darth Novius is the overseer of Morale and Innovation, a position that requires creativity, adaptability, and an
        understanding of the Brotherhood’s needs. Novius’s primary goal is to maintain the Brotherhood’s cohesion,
        ensuring that its members remain loyal, motivated, and focused on their collective purpose.<br /><br />Novius
        organizes grand events, ranging from combat tournaments to ceremonial celebrations of the Brotherhood’s
        victories. These events not only inspire loyalty but also foster competition among the ranks, pushing members to
        constantly improve themselves. He also introduces initiatives designed to enhance activity and engagement, such
        as reward systems for exceptional performance and opportunities for acolytes to interact with high-ranking Sith
        Lords.<br /><br />Novius’s role is not without its challenges. The Brotherhood is an organization built on
        ambition and rivalry, and maintaining unity among its members often feels like balancing on the edge of a blade.
        However, Novius’s innovative approach and deep understanding of Sith psychology make him uniquely suited to this
        role.

        large-scale warfare. His genius lies in his ability to coordinate devastating assaults that leave the
        Brotherhood’s enemies crippled and demoralized.<br /><br />Stryker oversees the planning and execution of raids
        on Jedi temples, Republic outposts, and rival factions. These missions are not only acts of aggression but also

        brutality, striking with overwhelming force and retreating before the enemy can mount a
        counterattack.<br /><br />Stryker is a warrior to his core, often leading raids personally to inspire his troops
        and strike fear into the hearts of his enemies. His reputation as an unstoppable force on the battlefield has

        that inspire awe and terror in equal measure.<br /><br />Under Umbral’s leadership, the Inquisitorius has become
        one of the most feared arms of the Brotherhood. Her agents scour the galaxy for Jedi fugitives, rogue Sith, and

        and combat prowess to eliminate threats to the Brotherhood’s supremacy.

        threats before they arise. Valerian’s agents are masters of stealth and subterfuge, operating in the shadows to
        ensure the Brotherhood remains one step ahead of its enemies.<br /><br />Valerian’s methods are as enigmatic as
        they are effective. He relies on a vast network of informants, spies, and assassins, all of whom operate under
        layers of secrecy. His ability to anticipate and counter his enemies’ moves has earned him the Emperor’s trust,
        as well as the fear of his rivals.<br /><br />Valerian is known for his cold and calculating demeanor. He believes
        that information is the ultimate weapon and wields it with surgical precision. Whether infiltrating Jedi
        enclaves or destabilizing Republic governments, the Intelligence Initiative operates with ruthless efficiency
        under his watch.

        instilling in them a sense of purpose beyond individual ambition: to uphold the Emperor’s vision at any
        cost.<br /><br />In combat, Aegis is a towering force, clad in heavy armor and wielding a crimson blade that
        burns with the fury of the dark side. His presence inspires fear in enemies and unwavering loyalty in allies. To
        stand against Aegis is to face the full wrath of the Sith Brotherhood’s discipline and strength.

      <p class="description">
        Deep within the Great Temple on Yavin IV lies the Council Chamber, a massive circular room carved from ancient
        stone and infused with dark side energy. Twelve ornate thrones surround the Emperor's seat, each representing
        one of the Dark Lords. The chamber itself pulses with malevolent power, amplifying the connection between the
        Council members and the dark side entity that guides them.

        their connection to the entity. Blood offerings, ancient incantations, and displays of power mark these solemn
        occasions.
