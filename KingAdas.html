        Adas was king of Korriban and the Sith in a reign that lasted nearly three hundred years. He was large for his
        species, his skin was unusually charcoal-colored, and he was raised as a chosen being from his
        youth.<br /><br />Encasing himself in ebon armor, he wielded a massive battle ax and became a master of Sith
        magic. Circa 28,000 BBY, Adas united the disparate nations of Korriban in a series of bloody conflicts,
        eventually solidifying himself as the sole leader of his people.<br /><br />The Sith hailed Adas as the
        Sith'ari, or "Overlord." The commonly held belief was that he was invincible and that his reign would be
        eternal. Circa 27,700 BBY, Rakata from the Infinite Empire arrived on Korriban and taught Adas how to harness
        the technology of holocrons. Adas created one of these devices but soon realized that the new arrivals were
        attempting to conquer Korriban. He took his battle-ax to the aliens, and with his people at his side, drove them
        off. In doing so, he lost his life.<br /><br />Adas's influence, however, would continue for many years
        following his death. His holocron would later be granted to the Exiles in 6900 BBY, when the reign of the first
        Jen'ari, or "Dark Lord" of the Sith began. It would later be lost on Ashas Ree during the Great Hyperspace War,
        where it would later be found by fallen Jedi Knight Freedon Nadd, who used Adas's teachings to subjugate and
        rule Onderon.
